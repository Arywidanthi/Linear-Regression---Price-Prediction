# Uber-Lyft Price Prediction
## Project Goal: Create a Regression model using Linear Regression to predict ride-hailing platform trip prices with the provided dataset.

### Brief explanation of the project
The data in this porject is uber and lyft fare dataset. The dataset is from kaggle where the main purpose and objective of this large dataset is to model how price or cab fare varies with all the features that've been given.

### File:
- h8dsft_P1G1_AryWidanthi.ipynb is the file that consist of code for regression model.
- Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma

### Weaknesses and Strengths
Strength: Data already clean and ready to analyze and create machine learning model with it
Weaknesses: Still can improve to get a good fit model, unfinished model deployment
